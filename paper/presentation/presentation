Part I :

Chapter I
▷ Virtualizaion
      ◦ Overview
      ◦ Components
      ◦ Types
      ◦ Pros
      ◦ Cons

Overview
    🢖 What is it
    🢖 How it works
    🢖 Somthing else
# I talk about what is virtualization, what role it played in the industry development over time

# @black/type1_virtualizaion_black.png


Components
    🢖 Guests
    🢖 Hypervisor
    🢖 Host

@black/Type-1vs2-Hyp_black.png

Types
    🢖 Para-Virtualization
    🢖 Hardware Assisted
    🢖 Full Virtualization
# Explain how virtualization works, hypervisors and their types - guests. And virtualization types [ Full, Hardware Assisted, Para ]

Pros
    🢖 Security
    🢖 Isolation
    🢖 Well Tested

Cons
    🢖 Relatively Slow
    🢖 High Resource Consumption
    🢖 Cause Resource Overuse

#---------------CHAPTER II---------------------
Chapter II
▷ Containerization
      ◦ What is it
      ◦ Software
      ◦ Pros
      ◦ Cons

What is Containerization ❓
# Talk about what is containerization, it's parent chroot and how it evolved

@black/containerization_black.png
# Explain the diagram and why Containerization is much lighter that virtualization, and what are the use cases

Available Software
    🢖 Engines
    🢖 Orchestrators
# What software can be used to deploy containerization

Pros
Why Containerization ?
    🢖 Light wight 🪶
    🢖 Lightning Fast ⚡
    🢖 Scalable 📤
#Here why it must be used in our infrastructures

Cons
    🢖 Relatively Low Isolation
    🢖 Low Security
    🢖 Highly Complicated Architecture 😿
# What are the issues we're facing with this relatevly new technology

#---------------CHAPTER III---------------------
Chapter III 
▷ Security
  ◦ Threats
  ◦ Guidelines
# Let's address the security issues since they're the most important in any field
#- Security ☣️
#- Security ☢️
#- Security 💀
#- Security 💀

Threats
    🢖 Kernel Exploits ☠️
    🢖 Breakouts ☣️
    🢖 Secret Compromise
    🢖 root in = root out 💀
    🢖 Denial Of Service
    🢖 Privilige Escalation ☢️
    🢖 Poisoning

What can we do ?
Guidelines
    🢖 Virtualizing
    🢖 SELinux
    🢖 Cgroups
    🢖 Audit
    🢖 Results

#Solutions
Containerization
          VS
Virtualizaion !!!
🢖 It's Not A War

# Why using containerization doesn't nesserilly mean that we're going to get rid of virtualization

SELinux

@black/selinux_query_diagram_black.png
# What is SELinux and how it's developed by the NSA and DoD since the edward snowden leaks. How MAC works and why it's useful, TE, RBAC, MLS, MCS ...

Cgroups
# What is Cgroups how it's useful to limit resource consumption in containerization technology

Audit
# Local Repos, Image security and quality audit is important
