	    This a Qemu/KVM Web Interface that mainlly helps new users to test and
	    check Qemu and KVM inner workings. The motivation behinde this project
	    was that during the time over of which I've been using Qemu and KVM
	    a handful of people told me that it was intimidating to use it.
            </p>

	    The project structure is rather simple, it consists of four tabs in the
	    main interface namely "Create VM, Start VM, Downloads & Qemu".
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tile is-parent">
          <div class="tile is-child box">
            <p class="title">Three</p>
            <p>
	    The "Create VM" tab is a form that helps users to create a Virtual Machine
	    remotely on the server running this Web UI without any previous knowledge
	    of how to operate Qemu command line interface.
	    </p>
	    <br/>
	    <p>
	    The next important tab is the "Start VM" tab, this one allow the user to
	    start a Virtual Machine that he or an other user has created earlier.
            </p>
	    <br/>
            <p>
	    The "Downloads" tab contains downloadable content the helps the user to use
	    the web UI such as "VNC Clients". The content on this tab can be updated to
	    serve more tools or manuals in the future.
            </p>
	    <br/>
            <p>
	    Lastly the "Qemu" tab, this tab is there only for debugging purposes and
	    it's not meant to be used by end users, unless the required knowledge to
	    operate Qemu command line interface is acquired.
