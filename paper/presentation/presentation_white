#---------------CHAPTER I---------------------
Part I :
Chapter I

Virtualizaion

  ◦ What is it
  ◦ Pros
  ◦ Cons
# I talk about what is virtualization, what role it played in the industry development over time

@white/type1_virtualizaion_white.png
# Explain how virtualization works, hypervisors and their types - guests. And virtualization types [ Full, Hardware Assisted, Para ]

Pros

1. Security
2. Isolation
3. Well Tested

Cons

1. Relatively Slow
2. High Resource Consumption
3. Cause Resource Overuse

#---------------CHAPTER II---------------------

Containerization

  ◦ What is it
  ◦ Software
  ◦ Pros
  ◦ Cons

What is Containerization ❓
# Talk about what is containerization, it's parent chroot and how it evolved

@white/containerization_white.png
# Explain the diagram and why Containerization is much lighter that virtualization, and what are the use cases

Available Software
# What software can be used to deploy containerization

Pros
Why Containerization ?
#Here why it must be used in our infrastructures

- Light wight 🪶
- Lightning Fast ⚡
- Scalable 📤

Cons
# What are the issues we're facing with this relatevly new technology

- Relatively Low Isolation
- Low Security
- Highly Complicated Architecture 😿

#---------------CHAPTER III---------------------
III

Security
  ◦ Threats
# Let's address the security issues since they're the most important in any field

Threats

#- Security ☣️
#- Security ☢️
#- Security 💀
#- Security 💀
- Kernel Exploits ☠️
- Breakouts ☣️
- Secret Compromise
- root in = root out 💀
- Denial Of Service
- Privilige Escalation ☢️
- Poisoning

What can we do ?

Guidelines

  ◦ Virtualizing
  ◦ Namespaces
  ◦ SELinux
  ◦ Cgroups
  ◦ Results

#Solutions
Guidelines

Containerization
        VS
Virtualizaion

It's Not a War
# Why using containerization doesn't nesserilly mean that we're going to get rid of virtualization

SELinux

@white/selinux_query_diagram.png
# What is SELinux and how it's developed by the NSA and DoD since the edward snowden leaks. How MAC works and why it's useful, TE, RBAC, MLS, MCS ...

Cgroups
# What is Cgroups how it's useful to limit resource consumption in containerization technology

Audit
# Local Repos, Image security and quality audit is important
